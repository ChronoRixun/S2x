S2x is a custom client project for **Call of Duty®: WWII**, focused on preserving and extending functionality for campaign, multiplayer, and zombies.

Join the S2x community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wdC8Jpc2cC).

The project is inspired by the work of the former XLabs community, but S2x is an independent project and is not affiliated with XLabs, Activision, Sledgehammer Games, Microsoft, or any related publisher, developer, or trademark holder.

## Requirements

You must own a legitimate Steam copy of **Call of Duty®: WWII** to use S2x.

S2x does **not** provide game files, cracked executables, or any method to obtain the game without purchasing it. Please support the original developers and publishers by owning a legal copy of the game.

## Compile from source code

- Clone the Git repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). **Do not download it as a ZIP**, as that will not include the required submodules.
- Run the `generate.bat` script to generate the project solution.
- Build the project using the generated solution file at `build\s2x.sln`.

## Playing against bots

Start Multiplayer, open the console with the tilde/backtick key and load a map with a gametype:

```text
map mp_shipment_s2 dom
```

Once the map has loaded, add bots:

```text
spawnBot 6
```

To add bots automatically on every map start, set `bot_fill` once (it is saved with your profile):

```text
bot_fill 6
map mp_shipment_s2 tdm
```

Set `bot_fill 0` to disable it again. Bots count toward the player limit of the match, and progression works in these matches.
