S2x is a custom client project for **Call of Duty®: WWII**, focused on preserving and extending functionality for campaign, multiplayer, and zombies.

Join the S2x community on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wdC8Jpc2cC).

The project is inspired by the work of the former XLabs community, but S2x is an independent project and is not affiliated with XLabs, Activision, Sledgehammer Games, Microsoft, or any related publisher, developer, or trademark holder.

## Requirements

You must own a legitimate Steam copy of **Call of Duty®: WWII** to use S2x.

S2x does **not** provide game files, cracked executables, or any method to obtain the game without purchasing it. Please support the original developers and publishers by owning a legal copy of the game.

## Compile from source code

- Clone the Git repository using [Git](https://git-scm.com/install/windows) or [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/). **Do not download it as a ZIP**, as that will not include the required submodules.
- Run the `generate.bat` script to generate the project solution.
- Build the project using the generated solution file at `build\s2x.sln`.

## Modding: loose file overrides

S2x loads loose files from `%LOCALAPPDATA%\s2x\data\` and `<game folder>\s2x\` before the packaged game assets.

- **GSC scripts**: `scripts\mp\*.gsc` (multiplayer and zombies) or `scripts\sp\*.gsc` (campaign), plus `scripts\mp\<mapname>\` and `scripts\mp\<gametype>\` subfolders.
- **UI scripts**: `ui_scripts\mp\<folder>\__init__.lua` or `ui_scripts\sp\<folder>\__init__.lua`.
- **String tables (`.csv`)**: place the file at the asset path, for example `%LOCALAPPDATA%\s2x\data\mp\botDivisionTable.csv` replaces `mp/botDivisionTable.csv`. Tables that do not exist in the game can be added the same way and read from GSC with `tablelookup`.

Console commands for string tables:

- `dumpstringtable mp/botDivisionTable.csv` exports the loaded table to `<game folder>\s2x\dump\mp\botDivisionTable.csv`. Edit the copy and move it into one of the loose file folders above.
- `listassetpool 59 <filter>` lists the names of loaded string tables.
- `reloadstringtables` drops the cached loose tables; edited files are also picked up automatically when the next map loads.
